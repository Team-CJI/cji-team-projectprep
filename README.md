1. Key strengths are deubugging, grammar and spell checking, adaptability, and creative writing.
2. Mob programming and double checking my partners code.
3. Confidence and Health and safety.
4. I personally would prefer to mob program and just keep everyones ideas in mind with the specific code, however there are times that my internet can be very iffy, so I understand that I might not be able to participate in every code, but I will do my best to ask questions to catch up.
